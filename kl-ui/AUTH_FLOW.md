# Authentication Flow Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Navigation
- Modified the user icon in `AppNavigation.vue` to point to `/login` instead of `/user`

### 2. Enhanced Login Page
- Updated `pages/login.vue` to redirect users to their appropriate dashboards based on roles
- Added `guest` middleware to prevent authenticated users from accessing the login page

### 3. Created Middleware System
- Created `middleware/auth.js` to protect routes that require authentication
- Created `middleware/guest.js` to prevent authenticated users from accessing guest-only pages
- Registered middleware in `nuxt.config.ts`

### 4. Updated User Dashboard
- Added `auth` middleware to `pages/user/index.vue` to ensure only authenticated users can access it
- Added a logout button to the user dashboard

### 5. Created Role-Based Dashboards
- Created basic dashboard pages for admin (`/admin`) and seller (`/seller`) roles
- Applied auth middleware to these pages as well

### 6. Enhanced Authentication Service
- Added `getUserRole()` method to determine user roles
- Added `redirectToDashboard()` method for client-side redirects

### 7. Updated Composables
- Enhanced `useAuth.js` to properly handle authentication state
- Added automatic redirect to login page after logout

## User Roles in the System

Based on the backend database structure, there are 5 user roles in the system:

1. **super_admin** - Highest level of access, can do everything in the system
2. **admin** - Administrative access to manage products, categories, users, and sellers
3. **seller** - Can manage their own products and prices
4. **sub_seller** - Limited seller permissions, can view products and prices
5. **user** - Regular user with basic permissions to view products and manage their profile

## How It Works

1. When users click the user icon in the navigation, they are directed to the login page
2. After logging in, they are redirected to their appropriate dashboard based on their role:
   - super_admin and admin users go to `/admin`
   - seller and sub_seller users go to `/seller`
   - regular users go to `/user`
3. Authenticated users cannot access the login or register pages
4. Unauthenticated users cannot access dashboard pages and will be redirected to the login page
5. Users can log out from their dashboard, which will redirect them to the login page

## Testing

To test the authentication flow:

1. Visit the homepage (`http://localhost:3000`)
2. Click the user icon in the top right corner
3. You should be directed to the login page (`http://localhost:3000/login`)
4. Log in with valid credentials
5. You should be redirected to your appropriate dashboard based on your role
6. Try accessing the login page again while authenticated - you should be redirected to your dashboard
7. Log out from your dashboard
8. You should be redirected back to the login page
